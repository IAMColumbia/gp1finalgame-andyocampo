Release Notes version 1 POC

Systems working so far:

Level generation with random tiles 
- (as of right now, the level may generate with matches).

Swapping tile locations
- (the code I wrote to check for neighboring tiles doesn't seem to be
   working correctly so as of now you can swap a tile with any other on the board).

Systems and bug fixes to be worked on:

- Calculating a match of 3 and 5+.
- Filling in more tiles from the top when a match has been made.
- Timer.
- Limited moves and amount of matches goal.
* Fixing the code that only allows the player to swap with neighboring tiles.
* Setting up a level with no matches at the start.
* Refactoring and separating concerns into different classes.
* Make code more portable.
