Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

Systems working so far:

Level generation with random tiles
* Level now starts with no matches

Swapping tile locations
* Tiles can now only be swapped with neighboring tiles

Matching
- (As of right now, only matches of 3 can be made which will be changed in final release)

Refilling empty tiles
- (As of right now, the board does not clear matches that were created when refilling
the board and matches that are created during refill will be removed after player makes
new match).

Systems and bug fixes to be worked on:

- UI
- Timer.
- Limited moves and amount of matches goal.
* Fix matching calculations to allow matches of 3+ tiles.
* Fix refilling of empty tiles to clear matches created during refill.
* Refactoring and separating concerns into different classes.
* Make code more portable.
